# tex-jp-build

This bundle provides a minimum subset of TeX Live subversion repository
for building binaries of Japanese TeX processing tools.
This bundle also provides the latest "upstream" sources for the followings:

* ptexenc
* ptex, (u)pbibtex, (u)pdvitype, (u)ppltotf, (u)ptftopl
* eptex extention as a part of euptex
* makejvf
* mendex
* dviout-util

Other tools and libraries (kpathsea, dvips, dvipdfmx etc.) are prepared
only for easy building/testing of an experimental environment for developers;
we do not intend to provide the "upstream" sources.
