.SH "NAME"
fmtutil.cnf \- configuration file for fmtutil
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIfmtutil.cnf\fP file contains the configuration information
for \fBfmtutil\fP(8).  Each line contains the name of the format
(e.g., ``tex\'\', ``latex\'\', ``omega\'\'), the name of the engine that
is used by that format (e.g., ``tex\'\', ``etex\'\', ``omega\'\'),
the pattern file (e.g., \fIlanguage.dat\fP, \fIlanguage.def\fP),
and any arguments (name of an \fI.ini\fP file).
.PP
Fields are separated by whitespace and complete lines can be commented
out with ``#\'\'.  The ``pattern file\'\' field cannot be used to
define a file that is used while building the format.
It tells \fBfmtutil\fP which files (separated by commas) the
format creation procedure reads and it has an effect to the options
\fI--showhyphen\fP and \fI--byhyphen\fP.
If the format has no way to
customize hyphenation, a ``-\'\' can be used to indicate this.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The \fBtex\fP(1) and \fBamstex\fP(1) formats always load
\fIhyphen.tex\fP.  No customization by a pattern file is available
for these formats. Therefore, the pattern-file field for the
\fBtex\fP and \fBamstex\fP is usually indicated to be empty (``-\'\').
.PP
You can, however, build customized formats on top of plain
\fBtex\fP(1) or \fBamstex\fP(1) by using \fIbplain.tex\fP instead of
\fIplain.tex\fP (b for the \fIBabel\fP system). See, for example,
the \fIbplain.ini\fP file for the bplain format).
.PP
\fBetex\fP(1) loads \fIlanguage.def\fP, not
\fIlanguage.dat\fP.
.PP
Symbolic links to the correct engines (e.g., bplain -> tex)
are generated by the \fBtexlinks\fP(8) script.  Remember to run
\fBtexlinks\fP(8) if you run \fBfmtutil\fP(8) yourself, rather
than using the FORMATS option in \fBtexconfig\fP(8).
