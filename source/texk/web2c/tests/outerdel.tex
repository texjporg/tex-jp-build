%Subject: Re: skipping tokens through the end of an input file
%
%I think now I know what you want me to do; I saw the error
%report about \outer in an \edef on tex-k.
%
%Lets create two files:
%1) sub.tex (1 line):
%x\error y\noexpand
%
%2) main.tex (4 lines):
%\let\ea=\expandafter
%\def\zero{z}
%\ea\edef\ea\one\ea{\input sub.tex\relax\zero}
%\show\one\bye
%
%
%tex sub gives an error
%
%! Undefined control sequence.
%l.1 x\error
%            y\noexpand
%? 
%
%When you delete 1, 2, or 3 tokens at the ?-prompt it works as
%expected. With 2 you get the *-prompt and you can say \bye.
%With 3 you get the *-prompt too but now a \bye is deleted as
%one delete operation is still waiting. At the next *-prompt
%you can enter a valid \bye.
%With 1 a \bye at the *-prompt is not expanded and thus doesn't
%work. Again the next *-prompt accepts the \bye.
%
%
%With tex main you get the error as above.
%
%With <return> or 1 the definition is finished as the outerness of the
%eof is canceled by the \noexpand. With 2 the \noexpand is deleted too
%and a <return> at the next ?-prompt gives a runaway error:
%
%Runaway definition?
%->x
%! File ended while scanning definition of \one.
%<inserted text> 
%                }
%<to be read again> 
%                   \relax 
%l.4 \ea\edef\ea\one\ea{\input sub.tex\relax
%                                           \zero}
%? 
%
%Another <return> reports
%
%! Too many }'s.
%l.4 \ea\edef\ea\one\ea{\input sub.tex\relax\zero}
%                                                 
%?
%
%before the run ends with another <return>. \one is what I expect and a
%dvi is produced that shows `z' as expected.
%
%But with 2 and then a 1 (not a <return>) we get the runaway and with
%a <return>
%
%<inserted text> }
%                 
%<to be read again> 
%                   \relax 
%l.4 \ea\edef\ea\one\ea{\input sub.tex\relax
%                                           \zero}
%?
%
%so that the definition can be finished. With 3 instead of 2 the same
%happens.
%
%
%
%With the change that inserts OK_to_interrupt things change. When
%you enter now 2 and 1 or directly 3 you get
%
%)
%<recently read> \relax 
%                       
%l.4 \ea\edef\ea\one\ea{\input sub.tex\relax
%                                           \zero}
%? 
%
%That is y, \noexpand, and \relax are deleted. The outerness of the eof
%doesn't count now and there is no inserted } anymore.
%
%I would consider this wrong. Somewhere the file ended and this end should
%be treated as \outer. One could say in the last case the file ended with
%the x.
